******************************************************************
Example project building a C++ shared library from several classes
based on the ROOT toolkit
******************************************************************

Source files are automatically added to the Makefile.am which is
generated at the configure step by using one of the macros in
m4/create_rootlib_makefile_am.m4.

See INSTALL file for build instructions (special attention required
if you are working with Bazaar source branches)

When new source files are added, you must re-run ./configure in order
to update the Makefile.
